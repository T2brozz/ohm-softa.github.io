# Parallel Processing

## Threads

# Process

```java
class MyProgram {
	String name;
	MyProgram(String name) {
		this.name = name;
		System.out.println("Created MyProgram: " + name);
	}
	void printNum(int n) {
		System.out.println(name + ": " + n);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MyProgram mp = new MyProgram("Test");
		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
			mp.printNum(i);
	}
}
```

# Bean Counters

```java
class BeanCounter {
	private final String name;
	private final double[] data;
	BeanCounter(String name, int n) {
		this.name = name;
		this.data = new double [n];
	}

	public void run() {
		System.out.println(name + " is starting...");
		Arrays.sort(data);
		System.out.println(name + " is done!");
	}
}
```
```java
public static void main(String... args) {
	BeanCounter b1 = new BeanCounter("Bureaucrat 1", 10000);
	BeanCounter b2 = new BeanCounter("Bureaucrat 2", 1000);

	b1.run();
	b2.run();

	System.out.println("main() done!");
}
```

# Threaded Bean Counters

```java
class BeanCounter implements Runnable {
	// ...
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	BeanCounter b1 = new BeanCounter("Bureaucrat 1", 10000);
	BeanCounter b2 = new BeanCounter("Bureaucrat 2", 1000);

	new Thread(b1).start();
	new Thread(b2).start();

	System.out.println("main() done!");
}

# Threading: Examples

Multi-threaded programming is ubiquitous in modern applications:
- browser: loading multiple resources at a time using concurrent connections
- rendering multiple animations on a page/screen
- handling user interactions such as clicks or swipes
- sorting data using divide-and-conquer
- concurrent network, database and device connections
- ability to control (pause, abort) certain long-lasting processes

---

# Shared Resources

```java
class Counter {
	private int c = 0;
	int getCount() { 
		return c; 
	}
	void increment() {
		c = c + 1;
	}
}
```
```java
public class TeamBeanCounter implements Runnable {
	Counter c;
	TeamBeanCounter(Counter c) {
		this.c = c;
	}

	@Override
	public void run() {
		for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
			c.increment();
		}
		System.out.println("Total beans: " + c.getCount());
	}
}
```

---

# Shared Resources

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Counter c = new Counter();

	new Thread(new TeamBeanCounter(c)).start();
	new Thread(new TeamBeanCounter(c)).start();
	new Thread(new TeamBeanCounter(c)).start();
	new Thread(new TeamBeanCounter(c)).start();
}
```

```
Total beans: 362537
